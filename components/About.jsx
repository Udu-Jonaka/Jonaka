          <p>
            I’m Jonaka Udu (Jhay Codes), a growing software engineering student
            and full-stack web developer who loves turning ideas into fast,
            clean, and visually appealing digital experiences. I specialize in
            building modern, responsive websites using both frontend and backend
            technologies, and I’m constantly improving my skills to deliver
            high-quality, production-ready solutions. Whether it’s crafting
            smooth user interfaces or developing powerful backend features, I’m
            passionate about creating real value through code and helping
            businesses bring their ideas to life.
